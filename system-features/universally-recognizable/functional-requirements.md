# Functional Requirements

*   REQ-1: Users should fill ALL the fields when they attempt to create a contract.

    &#x20;
*   REQ-2: Users should fill valid data when creating a contract.

    &#x20;
*   REQ-3: Users need to have enough funds in their account whether it is when creating the contract to pay for the gas fees or paying the actual money when it is due.

    &#x20;
*   REQ-3: Users should only interact with the contracts they are associated with. If a customer tries to make a payment or execute something on the contract where he is the supplier, it will only tire the BC resulting in a high gas fee ending up with no result.

    &#x20;
* REQ-4: Users should have a wallet to use the platform. As of now only MetaMask is integrated.
