# User Class and Characteristics

Users of the system should be distinguished between being a supplier and being a customer. Given the parameters of the contracts, stated above such as the public addresses, amount to be paid and some terms proposed by the supplier. There are some functionalities that are already proposed. With these in mind only supplier should be allowed to create a contract to ease the system payload on the tool. Whether you are a customer or a supplier you should only be able to see the contract you are associated with, it is also possible to show everything but, in most cases, other contracts that you are not a part of will not concern you.

Your public address is key, but you should not enter that manually that would kill the purpose of signing a transaction on chain. You would need the public address of the customer, the contract duration and the amount to be paid each month. In the early stages there are also parameters like proposed terms by the supplier, but they are optional as they add no value to the functionality.
