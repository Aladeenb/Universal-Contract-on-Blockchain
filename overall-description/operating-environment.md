# Operating Environment

Operating environment is chosen to be the Ethereum blockchain. Since it is open source, we believe it works very well with our proposed design.

* Blockchain based system.
* Data is kept only on-chain.
* Platform: Built using Web3 and ReactJS.
* Smart contracts: Solidity.
*   Compiler for smart contracts: Truffle (JSON output).
