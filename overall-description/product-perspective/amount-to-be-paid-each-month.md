# Amount to be paid each month

This parameter is crucial for the smart contract to calculate the total payment as well as knowing how much or rather how many tokens to charge each recurring month. Instead of making the supplier entering the entire amount during the duration of the contract (duration of the contract \* monthly payment) we will let them enter the monthly payment and calculate the rest when we serve that information to the end user.
