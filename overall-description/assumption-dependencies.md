# Assumption Dependencies

The tool that we aim to come up with is decentralized. The application context is stripped down to its bare minimum as a lease contract that allows such or rather allowed to be run in such applications:

* A user needs not to be verified as a supplier and can just go on and create a contract (they are the ones paying the gas fees).
* A user whether they are customer, or a supplier should only be seeing the contracts that they are associated with. This could be further advanced to make 2 different columns since a user can be both a supplier and a customer on different contracts.
* Explorer should show all the available information when it comes to the details of the points. Whether it is a payment or the initiation of the contract.
* All available contracts to that specific user should only and ONLY be shown if they are logged in with their wallet to the correct account.
